# The Ace of Spades Clone
By Ethan Lafrenais


This repository contains my final senior year project for my highschool programming course. My goal was to recreate as much of the game [Ace of Spades Classic](https://www.buildandshoot.com/) as possible. 

All commits after commit [6f5079](https://github.com/Francessco121/AceOfSpadesClone/commit/6f5079ea222730ec6bd5b5ce0b12c41efb5979f2) are additions and fixes I've made to the project after finishing highschool.

I plan to update this repository with more details on how I made this clone, and the technologies that went into it! But for now, please [see the AoS page on my website](https://francessco.us/projects/ace-of-spades-clone) for more information.

## Content Notice

### Textures
Some textures in this repository are directly from the [OpenSpades project](https://github.com/yvt/openspades). I will remove these files from the repository if requested by the OpenSpades team. A [list of all files from OpenSpades can be found here](./src/Content/Textures/Gui/README.md).

## Documentation

All of the documentation for how the game works and development can be found under [the /docs folder](./docs/README.md).
