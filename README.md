# The Ace of Spades Clone
By Ethan Lafrenais


This repository contains my final senior year project for my highschool programming course. My goal was to recreate as much of the game [Ace of Spades Classic](https://www.buildandshoot.com/) as possible. 

All commits after commit [6f5079](https://github.com/Francessco121/AceOfSpadesClone/commit/6f5079ea222730ec6bd5b5ce0b12c41efb5979f2) are additions and fixes I've made to the project after finishing highschool. As of 11/10/2018 this project is officially archived. I have no intent to continue working on this project, it was fun while it lasted :). 

[See the AoS page on my website](https://francessco.us/projects/ace-of-spades-clone) for more information.

## Download
Binary releases of the game client, server, and world editor [can be found in the GitHub releases](https://github.com/Francessco121/AceOfSpadesClone/releases).

## Content Notice

### Textures
Some textures in this repository are directly from the [OpenSpades project](https://github.com/yvt/openspades). I will remove these files from the repository if requested by the OpenSpades team. A [list of all files from OpenSpades can be found here](./src/Content/Textures/Gui/README.md).

### Audio
Due to licensing issues, none of the game's sound files will be included in this repository. The game however will continue to function without sound.

## Documentation

All of the available documentation for how the game works and development can be found under [the /docs folder](./docs/README.md).
